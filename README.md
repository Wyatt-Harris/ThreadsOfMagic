⚙️ Technical Overview  
Concept	Implementation  
-Abstraction	Character is an abstract superclass defining core behavior.  
-Inheritance	Harry, Hermione, and Ron extend Character with unique traits.  
-Polymorphism	Each overrides performTurn() and handles events differently.  
-Arrays	Each character’s inventory is a fixed-size Item[] array.  
-Collections	Rooms use ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Item> and ConcurrentHashMap for flags.  
-Lambdas & Streams	Used for event handling (Consumer<Event>), inventory filtering, and logging.  
-Parallelism / Threads	Each character, the event dispatcher, and the logger run in independent threads.  
-Synchronization	The HorcruxFragment uses a ReentrantLock to prevent concurrent examination.  
-Functional Programming	Streams process inventory and events cleanly with concise lambda expressions.  
-Safe Concurrency	Uses BlockingQueue<Event>, ExecutorService, and ReentrantLock for safe coordination.
